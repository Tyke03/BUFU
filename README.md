# BUFU Web Hub - Complete Concept Outline
*"The Future of the Web is Ours to Build—One Feature at a Time"*

## Core Vision
BUFU Web Hub is a community-driven platform that evolves entirely through user voting. Starting as a simple sign-up site, it aims to become the most robust and feature-rich website ever created—potentially as vast as the internet itself (in theory). Every feature is decided by the community through a sophisticated voting system that rewards engagement and early adoption.
